<h2><a name="authenticated">Authenticated access</a></h2>

<p>Authenticated access is provided via the SSH protocol. Please
provide us with your public key, which you can generate via the
<code>ssh-keygen</code> program.  This will store your public key in
the file <code>.ssh/identity.pub</code> in your home directory.

<p>Once we have this information we will set up an account on
<code>ytht.net</code> and inform you by mail.  At this point you
should be able to check out a tree with CVS and add yourself to the
devweb/steering.html file to test write access.  See <a
href="#checkin">Checking in a change</a> for how to proceed with
checking in your changes.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="setup">Setting up your local CVS tree</a></h2>

<p>Once you can login to the machine, it's trivial to start using ssh
from your remote machine.  Set <code>CVS_RSH</code> in your
environment to "<code>ssh</code>".  Then issue the command</p>

<blockquote><p><code>
cvs -z 9 -d :ext:<i>username</i>@ytht.net:/home/cvs co bbs
</code></p></blockquote>

<p>where <i>username</i> is your user name at
<code>ytht.net</code>.  This will check out a new CVS tree that you
should be able to work with in the normal fashion, including
committing changes.</p>

<p>It is also possible to convert an existing CVS tree to use ssh by
replacing all the "Root" files in the local tree with the following
contents:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>
<i>username</i>@ytht.net:/home/cvs
</code></p></blockquote>

<p>To avoid the nuisance of having to supply your passphrase for each
operation, you may want to use <code>ssh-agent</code>(1) followed by
<code>ssh-add</code>(1) and entering your passphrase once for all.
Either start your session as a child of <code>ssh-agent</code> or run
it as a daemon and set the values of the environment variables
<code>SSH_AUTHENTICATION_SOCKET</code> and <code>SSH_AGENT_PID</code>
in each relevant process to what <code>ssh-agent</code> prints when it
starts.  To avoid messages about (lack of) X11 forwarding, put in your
<samp>$HOME/.ssh/config</samp> an entry like:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>
Host ytht.net<br />
ForwardX11 no
</code></p></blockquote>

<h2>Web pages</h2>

<p>When you check in changes to our web pages, they will
automatically be checked out into the web server's data area.</p>

<h2><a name="policies">Write access policies</a></h2>

<p>The GCC project grants some developers various levels of write
access to the GCC master sources.  CVS doesn't provide fine grained
control over access to the repository; therefore, we depend on each
developer to follow the appropriate policies.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Global write permission.</dt>
  <dd><p>A very limited number of developers have global write
  permission over the entire repository.  They may check in changes to
  any part of the compiler without approval from anyone else.  They
  may also approve other people's changes to any part of the
  compiler.</p></dd>

  <dt>Write after approval.</dt>
  <dd><p>This is folks that make regular contributions.People with 
  write after approval need to submit their patches to the list; once the
  patches have been approved by the appropriate maintainers the
  patches may be checked into the YTHT BBS sources.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The list of folks with write access to the repository can be found
in the devweb/steering file in the GCC distribution.</p>

<p>Also note that fixes for obvious typos in ChangeLog files, docs,
web pages, comments and similar stuff need not be approved.  Just
check in the fix.  We don't want to get overly anal about checkin
policies.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="testing">Testing changes</a></h2>

<p>All changes must be tested 
before they are checked in.  If you wrote the patch yourself, you
should test it yourself, unless there is a reason why someone else
must do it for you (for instance, if you are fixing a problem on a
system you do not have access to).  If you are checking in a patch for
someone else, you only need to test it if they did not.</p>

<p>You must test exactly the change you intend to check in; 
It is a good idea to re-test patches which were
submitted a long time ago before applying them, even if nothing
appears to have changed.</p>

<p>These rules are designed to ensure that checked-in code does not
contain bugs that prevent other people from continuing to get their
work done.  There will always be bugs, but these rules help to
minimize the amount of time where the tree does not build at
all. Repeated failure to adhere to these rules could result in the
revocation of check-in privileges.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="checkin">Checking in a change</a></h2>

<p>The following is meant to provide a very quick overview of how to
check in a change.  It is not meant to be a replacement for the CVS
manual but instead a supplement.  The CVS manual is distributed as
part of the CVS sources as a texinfo file.  <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org/cyclic/cvs/doc-blandy.html">
http://www.cvshome.org/cyclic/cvs/doc-blandy.html</a> contains a link
to an reasonably simple introduction to CVS.</p>

<p>In all the commands listed below, you can give an explicit list of
filenames to the cvs command.  We recommend you list files explicitly
when performing checkins to avoid accidental checkins of local
code.</p>

<p>We prefer that each CVS checkin be of a complete, single logical
change, which may affect multiple files.  The log message for that
checkin should be the complete ChangeLog entry for the change.  This
makes it easier to correlate changes across files, and minimizes the
time the repository is inconsistent.  If you have several unrelated
changes, you should check them in with separate cvs commit
commands.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sync your sources with the master repository via "<code>cvs
update -dP</code>" before attempting a checkin; this will save you a little
time if someone else has modified that file since the last time you
synced your sources.  It will also identify any files in your local
tree that you have modified.</li>

<li>Apply the patch to your local tree and update the ChangeLog file.
Use the current date/time for the ChangeLog entry, not the time that
the patch was submitted.</li>

<li>Make sure to rebuild any generated files that would be affected by
the patch.  Make sure to check them in along with the files explicitly
modified by the patch.</li>

<li>We recommend using "<code>cvs diff</code>" after applying a patch to a
local tree.  Review the output to make sure that only the changes you
wanted to check in will be checked in.  Also check to see if the
copyright dates need to be updated.</li>

<li>Use "<code>cvs commit</code>" to check in the patch.  You can enter
the log message via the "<code>-m</code>" argument to commit, or wait for
the editor window to appear and enter the log message in the editor
window.</li>

<li>After exiting the editor, CVS will connect to the YTHT BBS cvs server
and check in your changes.  When your prompt returns the checkin is
finished.  A message will be sent to the YTHT BBS  mailing
list indicating that a change was made.  CVS will provide a message if
an error occurs and it will not check in any files.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="example">Example check-in session</a></h2>

<p>Here's an actual check-in session for a patch John Carr recently
sent to the GCC list.  This was the ChangeLog for his change:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
Sun Feb  8 08:02:13 1998  John Carr  &lt;jfc@mit.edu>

   * bitmap.c (bitmap_debug_file): HOST_PTR_PRINTF converts a pointer,
   not a HOST_WIDE_INT.

   * calls.c (expand_call): Change test of expand_inline_function
   return value to stop compiler warning.

   * genattrtab.c (RTL_HASH): Cast pointer to long, not HOST_WIDE_INT.
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>First, I sync my local repository.</h3>

<blockquote><pre>
[/law/gcc] cvs update
? libobjc
? gcc/.ada
? gcc/jump.c.SAVE
? gcc/loop.c.SAVE
M MAINTAINERS
M Makefile.in
M gcc/loop.c
M gcc/cp/parse.c
M gcc/objc/Make-lang.in
M gcc/objc/Makefile.in
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The question marks indicate files in my local repository that are
not part of the official sources.  The "M" indicates files I've
changed locally for some unrelated work -- thus I have to be careful
to avoid checking them in.  A "U" would have indicated a file that CVS
updated because my local copy was out of date relative to the master
sources.</p>

<p>The local repository is now up to date.</p>

<h3>Apply the patch to the local source</h3>

<blockquote><pre>

<h3>Add ChangeLog entry by hand</h3>

<p>ChangeLog entries should be handled as straight text;
patches against ChangeLogs rarely apply correctly.</p>

<h3>Review changes for correctness</h3>

<p>The patch and its associated <code>ChangeLog</code> entry are in my
local tree; now I run <code>cvs diff</code> on the modified files and
review the output, verifying that it only contains the changes we want.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
[/law/gcc/gcc] cvs diff -c3p bitmap.c calls.c genattrtab.c
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Update Copyrights</h3>

<p>Review the changed files to see if any copyrights need updating, in
this particular case all three needed their copyrights updated.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
[/law/gcc/gcc] vi bitmap.c calls.c genattrtab.c
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Commit the changes to the central repository</h3>

<blockquote><pre>
[/law/gcc/gcc] cvs commit ChangeLog bitmap.c calls.c genattrtab.c
</pre></blockquote>

<p>My editor starts and I enter the log message; the lines starting
with <code>CVS:</code> are automatically added by CVS and will be
automatically removed:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
        * bitmap.c (bitmap_debug_file): HOST_PTR_PRINTF converts a pointer,
        not a HOST_WIDE_INT.

        * calls.c (expand_call): Change test of expand_inline_function
        return value to stop compiler warning.

        * genattrtab.c (RTL_HASH): Cast pointer to long, not HOST_WIDE_INT.

<p>Now write &amp; quit from the editor, and CVS will start the actual
checkin process....</p>

<blockquote><pre>
