Cthulhu should compile on any platform with a SUSV2 compatible build environment
and a c89 Compiler which supports alloca (or with an alloca library routine).

Build process for the impatient:

1.) Edit 'localconf'
2.) Run ./configure
3.) Run 'make'
4.) Run 'make install'

Cthulhu has been successfully compiled and tested on the following platforms:

	Linux 2.4.x (gcc 2.95.x) -- x86
	HP-UX 11.11i (HP cc) -- PA-RISC
	FreeBSD 4.6 (gcc 2.95.3) -- x86
	UnixWare 7.1.1 (UCB cc) -- x86
	SunOS 5.6 (gcc 2.95.2) -- sun4m

If you want to contribute to Cthulhu contact me. There's a lot to do
