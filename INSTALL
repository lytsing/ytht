This BBS has been tested on x86 machine running debian woody.
It should run on any linux system.
It perhaps will run on other Unix system.

For impatient users,

1. Add a user for running bbs service on your system
   You can name this user as "bbs" traditionaly.But you can name this user anything else.
   On redhat like linux and debian linux, just run a command like this:
   	adduser bbs

   Don't forget set a password for bbs user.

2.
   Edit site/bbsconfig.sample and site/seclist.txt.
   If you don't know what these mean,you can just leave them as they are.
   Make sure values of LAST_CGIPATH and LAST_HTMPATH is right if you would like
   to have a web interface.
   The default value for LAST_CGIPATH should work on RedHat 9.
   In Debian woody, LAST_CGIPATH should be /usr/lib/cgi-bin.

3.
   If you get souce code from our svn, you should run ./makedist.sh.
   If it complain for someting, please try upgrade your autoconf and automake.
   autoconf2.59 and automake1.70 should be a good choice.

4. Run the following commands to install bbs

   ./configure --with-site=sample
   make
   make install
   /home/bbs/bin/shminit

5. Make sure that you have stopped telnet service of your server. Run the
   standlone bbs daemon as root

   /home/bbs/bin/bbsd

6. try it

   telnet localhost

   'new' and create the 'SYSOP' account (case sensitive). This account will
   acquire full permissions in your BBS.


8. Login as 'new' and  Create the 'guest' account. Or if you want to disable 'guest', add
   'guest' to the list of ~bbs/.badname
