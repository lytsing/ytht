The first part of README is too long.

Merge rdist into the ssh distribution. -> ssh-1.4.x
  - patch for stdin/stdout
  - -P arguments
  - configure/makefile

Update protocol to send information about the accepted authentication
methods for the particular user after the user has been identified.
-> ssh-2.x?

Update protocol to send real client host name.  Add server
configuration options to specify firewall names, and disable Rhosts
authentication and trust the supplied name (with RSA, of course) if
the connection appears to be coming from the firewall.
-> ssh-2.x?

Update protocol to include session id to both sides of session key.
Change all encryption methods to use different keys for each direction.
-> protocol version 2?

Update protocol to use stronger MACs.
-> protocol version 2?

Extend protocol to easily permit ip-forwarding only servers without
authentication.

Update protocol to negotiate 16-bit packet size fields and string size fields.
-> ??

Some kind of access control for forwarded sockets (e.g., localhost only).

Check X11 authentication sometimes fails (particularly on HPUX).

npasswd-style checking for passphrases. mcduff@physics.uq.oz.au.

Check whether Kocher's timing attack is applicable to ssh.
Should ssh sleep a random time after each RSA computation?
--> should blind, in 1.3.1?

Add escape ~% to print out compression statistics.  Also, show
information about encryption status.

Host key fingerprints (ssh-keygen, shown when mismatch or new).
Thomas.Koenig@ciw.uni-karlsruhe.de.

Consider using snprintf instead of sprintf.

debug() should append \r\n when in raw mode.

servconf.c: log an error if unrecognized option/argument (but don't exit).

Some kind of "ftp" on top of ssh.

Add client option Verbose (same as -v option).

Fix (note not always the suggested fix):
> rfc-pg.c:56:exit used without including <stdlib.h>
> remove.c:5:unlink used without including <unistd.h>
> scp.c:265:tolocal begins with to, which is reserved for <ctype.h>
> scp.c:266:toremote begins with to, which is reserved for <ctype.h>

Store IP-address in utmp if host name too long?
From: Holger Trapp <Holger.Trapp@Informatik.TU-Chemnitz.DE>

Makefile.in: Warn if installing as non-root

RSAPrivateDecrypt sometimes fails on Alpha (keys < 1024 bytes).
Brad Karp <karp@eecs.harvard.edu>

/etc/issue or equivalent.

Check operation with RSAREF on alpha.

Test compiling with Solaris 2.4 native compiler (v 3.0).

Provide step-by-step instructions for using RSA authentication.

Check all uses of getpwuid, and see if they could be replaced by
getpwnam.  Now ssh may check the wrong home directory when there are
several accounts with the same uid.

Check that log messages from tcp_wrappers with ssh get logged.

Change userfile_gets to allow arbitrary long input lines. 

Add --with-system-gmp option to configure.

Add --with-system-zlib option to configure.
